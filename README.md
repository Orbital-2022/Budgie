## Motivation
As we began our tertiary education, the adult problem of managing personal finance became increasingly troublesome in daily life. Given the limited budget per month, how we should break down the expenses wisely and how we can track our daily expenses have become the biggest problems that we face every day. 

Like many others in this world, we often wonder where our money went, when we look at our bank statement at the end of the month. Therefore, why not create a web-based application for budget planning and spending-checking for ourselves?

## Target Audience
University students who have limited monthly allowance and wish to plan their expenses wisely

## Problem Identified

1. Many application or websites only provide basic daily spending tracking. Other features require purchasing.
2. Extra ads appear in most free applications, which worsens user experience.
3. Very few applications provides visualisation of expenses

## Aim

We hope to create a web-based application that can help one to set budgets for various categories, keep expenses on track and analyse personal finance in a convenient and clear way.

## Main features

1. Set monthly budget
2. Record daily expenses
3. Monthly view of expense to help students visualise their monthly expenses
