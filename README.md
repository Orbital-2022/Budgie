## Motivation

As we began our tertiary education, the adult problem of managing personal finance became increasingly troublesome in daily life. 

Given the limited budget per month, how we should break down the expenses wisely and how we can track our daily expenses have become the biggest problems that we face every day. Like many others in this world, we often wonder where our money went,ewhen we look at our bank statement at the end of the month. Therefore, why not create a web-based application for budget planning and spending-checking for ourselves?

## Problem Identified

1. Many application or websites only provide basic spending tracking. Other special features require purchasing
2. Extra ads appear in most applications, which worsens user experience.
3. Limited number of applications that include currency exchange calculation

## Aim

We hope to create a web-based application that can help one to set budgets for various categories, keep expenses on track and analyse personal finance in a convenient and clear way.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 
Starts the development server.
### `npm run build` 
Bundles the app into static files for production.
### `npm test` 
Starts the test runner.
### `npm run eject`
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
We suggest that you begin by typing:
### `cd my-app`
### `npm start`
