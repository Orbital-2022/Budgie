## Motivation
As we began our tertiary education, the adult problem of managing personal finance became increasingly troublesome in daily life. Given the limited budget per month, how we should break down the expenses wisely and how we can track our daily expenses have become the biggest problems that we face every day. 

Like many others in this world, we often wonder where our money went, when we look at our bank statement at the end of the month. Therefore, why not create a web-based application for budget planning and spending-checking for ourselves?

## Target Audience
University students who have limited monthly allowance and wish to plan their expenses wisely

## Main features

1. Set monthly budget
2. Record daily expenses
3. Monthly view of expense to help students visualise their monthly expenses
